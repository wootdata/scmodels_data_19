The original author of this model is Andy Dorizas (see "readme.txt")


Anyway, it seems the two biggest complaints with this model were its size and that it didn't hold the weapons properly.  Well, since noone else has done anything about it, I did.

I slimmed him down a bit and adjusted the arms so they're CLOSER to the actual skeleton. 
NOTE:  It's FAR from perfect; I'm NOT a modeler and I have very little experience with modeling... so any problems with the original model in regards to faces, vertices, etc are still there and plainly visible. 


Oh, and I updated to SC 4.0b animations.
